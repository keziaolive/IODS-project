##How are you feeling right now? 
I think the course will require quite *some* time and effort investment (more than I imagined),\ 
but since I have experienced using R in general it shouldn't be too challenging.

##What do you expect to learn?
I want to have a good workflow in R:  
  - managing my datasets while working,
  - making sure the data I use is publication ready & reproducible
  
##Where did you hear about the course?
The course suggestion appeared in my email, and after looking through the course description \ 
I thought it would be helpful.
